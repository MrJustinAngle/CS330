# CS330

The way I approach designing software, is I first understand the requirements I have for the software. Then I make a flow chart on what I want the software to do and how I want it to interact with the user. I then start coding the work. I've learned how to use OpenGL so if I ever decide to make a video game or virtual world, I am now able to do it.
Some development strategies I've learned for my 3D scenes, is to code each object one at a time, don't rush into the project, and to take your time in coding it. My approach has been consistent throughout the milestones, I was able to first understand the new features we were to add and then add the code to my project.
I want to become a software engineer and learning more in C++ and OpenGL gives me more languages and programs to learn. This will hopefully expand my knowledge in computer science.
